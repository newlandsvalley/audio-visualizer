audio-visualizer
================

This is simply an exercise to test the analyser node from my port of [purescript-webaudio](https://github.com/waterson/purescript-webaudio) and also to teach myself the rudiments of purescript-canvas. It is a partial re-implementation of the visualizer from the O'Reilly book [Web Audio API](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001552/) by Boris Smus.
